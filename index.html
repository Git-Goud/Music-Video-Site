          Just a small town girl
          Livin' in a lonely world
          She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
          Just a city boy
          Born and raised in South Detroit
          He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

          A singer in a smokey room
          The smell of wine and cheap perfume
          For a smile they can share the night
          It goes on and on, and on, and on

          Strangers, waitin'
          Up and down the boulevard
          Their shadows
          Searchin' in the night
          Streetlights, people
          Livin' just to find emotion
          Hidin' somewhere in the night

          Workin' hard to get my fill
          Everybody wants a thrill
          Payin' anything to roll the dice
          Just one more time
          Some will win
          Some will lose
          Some were born to sing the blues
          Oh, the movie never ends
          It goes on and on, and on, and on

          Strangers waitin'
          Up and down the boulevard
          Their shadows
          Searchin' in the night
          Streetlights, people
          Livin' just to find emotion
          Hidin' somewhere in the night

          Don't stop believin'
          Hold on to that feelin'
          Streetlight, people
          Don't stop, believin'
          Hold on
          Streetlights, people

          Don't stop believin'
          Hold on to that feelin'
          Streetlight, people
